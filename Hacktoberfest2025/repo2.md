**Language:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
**Contribution Type:** Feature enhancement  

**Description:**  
Implemented a new power-up in the Snake Evolution game that temporarily slows down the snake's speed. This feature adds an extra layer of strategy and excitement to the gameplay, allowing players to navigate challenging situations more effectively. The power-up was integrated using JavaScript and styled with CSS to match the game's aesthetic.
